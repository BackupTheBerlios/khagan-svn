this is very alpha code. You need pyphat to be installed from svn. Look at the readme in pyphat for where it goes.
the paths should look something like /om/synth/set_port_value 1 /909bass/Tune % 
% is the sub token, i.e % is replaced by the value of the widget 
for the pad currently all paths must be set. Double right click to get to edit on the pad... i'll fix it ;-)
